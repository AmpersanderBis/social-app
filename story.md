# A Father's Heartache

Once upon a time there was the land of Britannia which was ruled by a functional family, said to be *flawless*. The lord inherited this land from his predecessors, he was strict and *outspoken* but fair and loved by his people.
---
He and his wife, who was known to have the fairest skin in the land, had two children, both of whom were girls with a large age gap between them.
The land was usually *bustling* with activity and the people deeply adored the family despite their different social classes.

That is until the lord's wife died after trying to give birth to a male heir. The lord was distraught with sadness and became a recluse, leaving the diplomatic affairs and public appearances to his eldest daughter. She had received the best education a child of her age could have in the *likelihood* of her father's *untimely* *downfall*.
---
The people mourned for days and hoped that one day the lord would return to his former self. Until then, this *grim* period would continue.

A lot of time passed and while the eldest daughter resembled her father the youngest had inherited her mother's traits and reminded her family of the long departed lady. Her natural beauty could *enthral* any ill-willed person.

As such, they became *unduly* protective of her. She had grown up in the shadow of her sister and was not allowed to go out of the family's mansion without a chaperone.
---
From time to time, the lord left his personal chambers *surreptitiously*, trying not to garner attention to himself so that he could check on his daughters.
Anyone could see that he was not in the best of health. He had grown old and had a *ghastly* figure after *withering away* in his chambers for so long.
However, one day he had made a written announcement that he would give a speech to his people. Needless to say, the news of his reappearance caused an *upheaval* in the land.
---
On the day of his speech, the lord was accompanied by his two daughters, one on each side. What was a *bleak* man was now a resolute one. He was determined to make a change.

The people had reason to be apprehensive as the lord had not been seen in public for a long time. That's the reason why he was greeted with silence and eyes filled with uncertainty and anticipation.
---
The lord began his speech with a solemn tone. He spoke of the tragedy that had befallen his family and how he had been bereft of his wife's companionship. Thereafter, he spoke of his negligence and how he had failed both as a father and a lord.

The lord then proclaimed that his *dreadful* *staycation* was over and that he would be returning to his duties.
Those words were met with applause and that *ineffable* speech *ushered* a new era for the land of Britannia. The people couldn't be more *enthused* over his return.

His daughters broke etiquette and ran to their father, embracing him in a tight hug.
---
Soon enough, the eldest daughter was completely relieved of her duties and the youngest was allowed to live an unrestrained life. They both gained their freedom but even so, they were *unwilling* to leave their father's side.

They cherished every little moment they had with him and offered prayers to their defunct mother and the unborn child that was lost to them.
